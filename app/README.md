# Shiny app

The app lets you explore different statistical distribution (commonly used in R and JAGS), understand a simple Bernoulli model using frequentist and Bayesian inference, explore the influence of the prior distribution, then see how data cloning works.

See the deployed app [here](https://psolymos.shinyapps.io/dcapps/).
